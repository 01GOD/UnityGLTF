# Shader Info

This shader was created in Shader Forge which can be purchased here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14147

The shader uses a metallic-roughness physically based rendering model vs Unity's metallic-glossiness model.

The metallic and roughness channels are stored in a single texture with the metallic channel on red and the roughness channel on green.

It's a work in progress and does not currently support opacity. There are likely bugs and we could use some help fixing them.
